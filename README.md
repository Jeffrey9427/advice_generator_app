## My process

From the HTML file, I started to build the layout for my webpage based on the provided desktop design. Next, I worked on the CSS stylesheet to match the visualization outlined in the challenge. Lastly, I handled the random advice generation and button function with basic Javascript knowledge.

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### What I learned

This challenge provided me an opportunity to recall the HTML, CSS, and JS concepts learned from HCI course in semester 1. Additionally, I learned how to fetch API data effectively in order to generate a random advice on my website.

### Continued development

I will use this simple project as an opportunity to continue learning and practicing web development skills, such as working with different devices sizes and functionalities or features.
